# Workday Scheduler

## Description

The Workday Scheduler allows for employers/employees to map out what their day will look like. It allows for information to be inputted hourly and saved at your convenience so that you can exit and return to at any point during the day. The hours will display different colors depending on the time of the day (i.e gray for past, red for present, green for future).
